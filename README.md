## bash-script Notes

This is a collection of bash scripts I wrote while learning:

- bash
- a lot of random things about Linux/how-to-write-these-things

For the record, I didn't pick up a book or take a course. I just...Google'd. 

...*a lot*. You've been warned.

### Getting Started

To run any of these scripts you'll most likely have to enable execution permissions on the file to be able to run it.

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```
